<h1>Amazon Sales Report</h1>
<hr><p>In this project, I have used Jupyter Notebook and Python to clean and analyze Amazon sales data. The main steps involved were:</p>
<p>1.Data Cleaning:
Loading the Data: I have imported the sales data into a Jupyter Notebook using libraries like pandas.
Handling Missing Values: I identified and handled missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or removing the affected rows.
Data Transformation: I have transformed data types, standardized date formats, and corrected any inconsistencies in the data.
Data Analysis:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed EDA to understand the data better, using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
Sales Trends: I analyzed sales trends over time, identifying peak sales periods and any seasonal patterns.
Product Performance: I have evaluated the performance of different products and categories, identifying bestsellers and underperformers.
Customer Insights: I have gained insights into customer behavior, such as purchase frequency and average order value.
Visualization:
I have created various plots and charts to visualize the findings, making it easier to communicate insights and trends.</p><h2>Technologies Used</h2>
